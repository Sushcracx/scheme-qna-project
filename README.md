# scheme-qna-project
 This project aims to make information about Indian government schemes more accessible to citizens. It features a Question Answering system where you can ask questions in plain English (like "What help is available for farmers?" or "Schemes for student scholarships?") and get relevant scheme information in return. The system works by first automatically collecting data about schemes using a web scraper. It then uses an AI technique called Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), powered by sentence embeddings (using all-MiniLM-L6-v2) and efficient FAISS similarity search, to find and rank the schemes that best match your query from the collected data. An interactive demo built with Gradio is included to easily try out the system.
